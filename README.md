## Abstract
Waves is a generative sonification experiment with a Covid-19 hyperobject and related statistical data. It is a free musical interpretation of numbers, threateningly close and pathetically distant, elevated to a media cult and speaking a language common to all countries and peoples. The thematic context of the course allowed the author to consider health and telecom statistics on a timeline (Jan20-Mar21) as **_sensor data_**.  The project is dedicated to exploration of the common "infection-death-restoration" + "self-isolation-index" daily databases through tonal and atonal interpretations. It is built in Processing within [Wellen](https://github.com/dennisppaul/wellen) framework built by [Dennis Paul](https://dennisppaul.de/) and pursues a goal to bring an algorhytmic musical approach in communicating with data from the "COVID world" and our our inner experience of perception.

The final name of the project was shaped throughout the course. Various aspects of its understanding were formed and supplemented together with the author's study of basic music theory, algorithmic composition, data sonification, investigation of coronavirus pandemic issues, musical experiments, and direct immersion in data. 

### Firstly, Pandemic "Waves"
**The emotional narrative of the composition is built on the dynamics of the growth of the total number of diseases: it is segmented by shares of the total final number of diseases.**

Over the past year, the terms "first," "second," and "nth **wave of coronavirus**" have become widely used. In some cases, they refer to periods of increasing numbers of infections and deaths (worldwide or locally), which, after reaching a peak, change to a declining trend.

A different interpretation of coronavirus waves is suggested by Temitope Fisayo and Sonia Tsukagoshi in the paper ["Three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic"](https://pmj.bmj.com/content/97/1147/332). The authors consider pandemic waves in the context of the time frame and the direct or indirect relationship of the virus to negative health consequences (the first wave is a short-term direct relationship; the second is medium-term, indirect, caused by health system dysfunction; the third is long-term, related to economic consequences, the impact on vulnerable groups and the future of the next generations).

Initially, the author wanted to focus on the data of a particular city - St. Petersburg, Russia was chosen as the basis. However, a decrease in the level of confidence in the reliability of the data, as well as the desire to create a "universal" tool for data sonification, refocused the project on global data. Working with aggregated statistics, the author sought to reduce the impact of distorting factors and look at the big picture. At the same time, the potential for scaling the project to regions and cities remains.

### Secondly, Clinging to the familiar "human" time scale.
**The volatility of values on a scale of days, weeks, and months formed the basis of the melodic and rhythmic component.**

The familiar weekly and monthly cycle of measuring time is used by mankind almost everywhere. The day as an object, a "medium of existence," "time-space," is taken by the author as a point of reference. It is also the minimum value on the statistical scale.

Working with data on infections by day, it is easy to find the so-called "weekend effect," where the number of cases or deaths varies significantly over the weekend: [scientists attribute this](https://dearpandemic.org/covid-19-numbers-lower-on-the-weekends/) to the lower availability of tests, speed of results and other factors. 

Increasing or decreasing values within the weekly cycle became the basis for three competing, similar-sounding minor-scaled instruments that embodied: the daily number of infections, the daily number of deaths, and the daily number of cures.

_Here is an element of a chart showing, on a logarithmic scale, the "competition" of daily values of the number of infections, deaths and recoveries:_ 
![Covid stats showing "Weekend effect"][image3]

Seeking to examine cyclical fluctuations in the context of averaged weekly and monthly dynamics, the author created **an environment where one can simultaneously "hear the data" and "hear the music"** (musical phrases, repetitive components, rhythmic segmentation).

#### "Binary experiment"
Also, the author attempted to "disconnect from reality" an already difficult for individual understanding "big number" - the total number of recorded cases. This value in each monthly period was translated into a binary code, the sequence of which became the basis for the bass line. 

### Thirdly, Wave as a physical phenomenon
Sonifying coronavirus statistics, it is difficult to avoid the association with sound or light waves. Interference in a musical context sends us to frequency modulation, where the author from the beginning to the end point of the composition sets the nature of the modulation through mapped values of statistical data (number of diseases, number of convalescences, values of the index of mobile activity).

The synthesized signal increases the emotional tension to a maximum by the very end of the composition, leaving the listener alone with the "current moment" in which the composition breaks off. 

### Fourthly, Wellen as "Waves"
The Wellen (formerly Ton) [framework](https://github.com/dennisppaul/wellen) was also developed in parallel with the course project by the Prof. Dennis Paul. Based on the Processing programming language, it allowed learning the basics of algorithmic composition from basic to much more complex elements. Extensive possibilities for this framework keep interest in the development of the project.

_Coincidentally, its name is the German equivalent of the English word "Waves":)_

## Tools used
* **Wellen Framework** for Processing Language as the basis for final project implementation* 
* **Derivative TouchDesigner**. In parallel with the study of the Processing language and Wellen framework, the author created prototypes of the interaction of statistical data with the generation of sounds and sound characteristics in a visual programming environment.
* **Google Sheets and LibreOffice Calc**. Most of the composition is based on the number of daily and total infections, deaths and recoveries in the world (from the covid observer portal), and Apple mobile activity index (how often users navigated every day). Therefore, creation of aggregated datasets, basic visualization and conversion to .csv required a proper software tool


## Further developments:
* scalability (different countries, regions and cities)
* code optimization
* visual interpretation
* fixing bugs  
* playing around with TREND functions and predictions/retrospective sound interpretations
